- Solana Web3.js and Wallet Adapters
- SVG for network logos and icons
- **PWA Technologies**: Service Workers, Web App Manifest, Background Sync
- **Offline Storage**: IndexedDB and Cache API

## Next.js Architecture

- The application uses a standard Next.js architecture with SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
- The project structure follows Next.js conventions with `/pages`, `/components`, and `/contexts`
- Page layouts are applied consistently using the Layout component in `_app.js`
- Dynamic imports with `{ ssr: false }` are used for client-side only components

## Important CSS Notes

- When using CSS `@import` rules, they **must** be placed at the top of the stylesheet, before any other CSS rules or declarations.
- Each `@import` rule should be on its own line with proper formatting and semicolons.
- Add extra line breaks between imports and the first CSS rule to ensure proper parsing.
- Next.js enforces this CSS standard strictly, whereas some other build systems might be more forgiving.
- Only `@charset` and `@layer` declarations can precede `@import` rules.
- The main stylesheet is at `src/styles/globals.css` which imports styles from the public directory.
- Example of correct formatting:
  ```css
  @import "/path/to/file.css";
  
  @import "/path/to/another.css";
  
  /* First CSS rule after imports */
  :root { ... }
  ```
