# Governance Framework for Reward Parameter Updates

## Overview

This document outlines the governance framework for managing reward system parameters in the P2P Exchange platform, addressing the feedback to "plan future governance for reward parameter updates for decentralization."

## Current State

The reward system currently uses admin-only controls for:
- Reward rate per trade (`reward_rate_per_trade`)
- Reward rate per governance vote (`reward_rate_per_vote`) 
- Minimum trade volume for rewards (`min_trade_volume`)
- Reward token initialization and configuration

## Governance Transition Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Admin Controls (Current)
**Timeline**: Already implemented
**Features**:
- Admin-only reward parameter updates
- Event-based monitoring for parameter changes
- Clear audit trail for all modifications

**Smart Contract Changes**:
```rust
// Add parameter update instruction
pub fn update_reward_parameters(
    ctx: Context<UpdateRewardParameters>,
    reward_rate_per_trade: Option<u64>,
    reward_rate_per_vote: Option<u64>,
    min_trade_volume: Option<u64>,
) -> Result<()>
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Signature Governance (6-month timeline)
**Features**:
- Transition from single admin to multi-signature governance
- Require 3-of-5 signature threshold for parameter changes
- Include key stakeholders: platform team, large traders, long-term users

**Implementation**:
```rust
#[account]
pub struct GovernanceConfig {
    pub authorities: [Pubkey; 5],        // 5 governance members
    pub threshold: u8,                   // Require 3 signatures
    pub pending_changes: Vec<ParameterChange>,
    pub voting_period: i64,              // 7 days for voting
}

#[account]
pub struct ParameterChange {
    pub proposal_id: u64,
    pub parameter_type: ParameterType,
    pub new_value: u64,
    pub proposer: Pubkey,
    pub votes_for: u8,
    pub votes_against: u8,
    pub executed: bool,
    pub expiry: i64,
}
```

### Phase 3: Token-Based Governance (12-month timeline)
**Features**:
- Reward token holders can propose and vote on parameter changes
- Voting weight proportional to token holdings
- Quorum requirements for valid proposals
- Time-delayed execution for security

**Governance Mechanics**:
- **Proposal Requirements**: Minimum 1% of total supply to propose
- **Voting Period**: 7 days for community voting
- **Quorum**: 10% of circulating supply must participate
- **Majority**: 51% approval for standard changes, 67% for critical changes
- **Time Lock**: 48-hour delay before execution

**Smart Contract Structure**:
```rust
#[account]
pub struct Proposal {
    pub id: u64,
    pub proposer: Pubkey,
    pub title: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub parameter_changes: Vec<ParameterChange>,
    pub votes_for: u64,
    pub votes_against: u64,
    pub total_votes: u64,
    pub start_time: i64,
    pub end_time: i64,
    pub executed: bool,
    pub quorum_reached: bool,
}

#[account]
pub struct Vote {
    pub proposal_id: u64,
    pub voter: Pubkey,
    pub vote_weight: u64,
    pub vote_type: VoteType, // For, Against, Abstain
    pub timestamp: i64,
}
```

### Phase 4: Advanced Governance (18-month timeline)
**Features**:
- Delegation mechanisms for liquid democracy
- Specialized committees for different parameter types
- Automatic parameter adjustments based on metrics
- Emergency governance procedures

## Parameter Categories and Governance Requirements

### Tier 1: Routine Adjustments (Standard Governance)
- Minor reward rate adjustments (Â±20% of current values)
- Minimum trade volume adjustments
- **Requirements**: 51% approval, 10% quorum, 7-day voting period

### Tier 2: Significant Changes (Enhanced Governance)
- Major reward rate changes (>20% adjustment)
- Introduction of new reward categories
- **Requirements**: 67% approval, 15% quorum, 14-day voting period, expert committee review

### Tier 3: Critical Changes (Super-Majority Governance)
- Fundamental tokenomics changes
- Migration to new reward systems
- Emergency parameter freezes
- **Requirements**: 75% approval, 20% quorum, 21-day voting period, mandatory security audit

## Economic Safeguards

### 1. Parameter Bounds
```rust
pub struct ParameterLimits {
    pub min_reward_rate_per_trade: u64,   // 50 tokens
    pub max_reward_rate_per_trade: u64,   // 500 tokens
    pub min_reward_rate_per_vote: u64,    // 25 tokens
    pub max_reward_rate_per_vote: u64,    // 250 tokens
    pub min_trade_volume: u64,            // 0.01 SOL
    pub max_trade_volume: u64,            // 10 SOL
}
```

### 2. Rate Limiting
- Maximum one parameter change per 30 days per category
- Cool-down periods between major adjustments
- Emergency procedures for critical situations

### 3. Economic Impact Analysis
- Mandatory impact assessment for Tier 2+ changes
- Historical analysis requirements
- Community feedback periods

## Conclusion

This governance framework provides a clear path toward decentralization while maintaining system stability and security. The phased approach allows for iterative improvement and community feedback, ensuring the reward system remains fair, effective, and aligned with user interests.

The implementation prioritizes:
1. **Security**: Multi-layered approval processes and emergency procedures
2. **Transparency**: All governance actions are publicly auditable
3. **Inclusivity**: Broad community participation in decision-making
4. **Stability**: Economic safeguards prevent harmful parameter changes
5. **Evolution**: Framework adapts to changing community needs

Regular reviews and updates to this governance framework will ensure it remains effective as the platform and community evolve.
