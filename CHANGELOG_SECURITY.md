# Security Upgrade Changelog
## Solana P2P Exchange Protocol v2.0.0

**Release Date**: August 2025  
**Security Focus**: Critical vulnerability fixes and comprehensive security hardening  
**Breaking Changes**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Admin operations now require multi-sig (configurable)

## üö® Critical Security Fixes

### [CRITICAL] SOL Drainage Vulnerability (CVE-2024-001)
**Impact**: Prevented potential loss of user funds through escrow manipulation

**Changes**:
- Added comprehensive validation in `execute_verdict` function
- Implemented proper rent-exempt balance calculations  
- Added dispute-offer association verification
- Enhanced buyer/seller identity validation
- Added maximum transfer amount validation

```rust
// Before: Vulnerable to drainage
let escrow_balance = escrow_account.to_account_info().lamports();
invoke_signed(&transfer_instruction, ..., escrow_balance)?;

// After: Secure with validation
let minimum_rent_exempt = Rent::get()?.minimum_balance(EscrowAccount::LEN + 8);
let transferable_amount = escrow_balance.checked_sub(minimum_rent_exempt)?;
if transferable_amount > offer.amount.checked_add(offer.security_bond)? {
    return Err(error!(ErrorCode::InvalidAmount));
}
```

### [CRITICAL] Admin Centralization Risk (CVE-2024-002)  
**Impact**: Eliminated single point of failure in admin operations

**Changes**:
- Extended `Admin` struct to support multi-signature operations
- Added `secondary_authorities` field for up to 3 admin keys
- Implemented `required_signatures` for configurable threshold
- Added `update_admin_authorities` function for upgrading to multi-sig
- Created `validate_admin_authority` helper for multi-sig verification

```rust
// Enhanced Admin struct
pub struct Admin {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub secondary_authorities: [Pubkey; 2], // Multi-sig support
    pub required_signatures: u8, // 1-3 signatures required
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

## üîí High Severity Security Improvements

### Enhanced Input Validation
- Added zero amount validation for all monetary operations
- Improved UTF-8 string sanitization with `validate_and_process_string`
- Enhanced boundary checking for evidence submissions
- Added comprehensive error handling with specific error codes

### State Management Security
- Improved transaction atomicity through enhanced validation
- Added proper PDA validation throughout instruction execution
- Enhanced error propagation to prevent partial state updates

### Vote Validation Hardening
- Added explicit tie-breaking logic to prevent manipulation
- Enhanced vote counting with overflow protection
- Improved juror validation and anti-double-voting mechanisms
- Added comprehensive vote verification

```rust
// Explicit tie-breaking logic
let recipient = if dispute.votes_for_buyer > dispute.votes_for_seller {
    buyer
} else if dispute.votes_for_seller > dispute.votes_for_buyer {
    seller
} else {
    return Err(error!(ErrorCode::TiedVote)); // Ties rejected
};
```
