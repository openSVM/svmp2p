- **Test Coverage**: Deadline enforcement and expiration testing

### Input Validation
- **Enhancement**: ISO currency codes, string length limits
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive input validation tests

## 🛡️ Test Suite Architecture

### 1. Security Audit Tests (`security_audit_tests.ts`)
```typescript
// Complete vulnerability testing
- Fund drainage attack simulation
- Race condition testing  
- Overflow protection verification
- Authorization bypass attempts
- Input validation edge cases
```

### 2. Unit Tests (`unit_tests.ts`)  
```typescript
// Module-by-module testing
- Admin operations (initialization, authority updates)
- Offer lifecycle (create, list, accept, complete)
- Dispute resolution (open, assign, vote, execute)
- Reputation system (create, update, calculations)
- Error handling (all error codes)
```

### 3. Integration Tests (`integration_tests.ts`)
```typescript
// End-to-end workflow testing
- Complete successful trade flow
- Multi-party dispute resolution
- Concurrent operations handling
- Performance benchmarking
- Error recovery scenarios
```

## 🧪 Test Execution Strategy

### Local Development
```bash
# Run individual test suites
npm run test:security    # Security vulnerability tests
npm run test:unit        # Unit tests for all modules  
npm run test:integration # End-to-end integration tests

# Run comprehensive test suite
npm run test:comprehensive
```

### Continuous Integration
```bash
# Full audit with coverage analysis
npm run audit:security

# Performance benchmarking
npm run test:integration -- --grep "Performance"
```

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Transaction Throughput
- **Target**: >10 TPS for offer creation
